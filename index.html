	<h2>“Nihilism and Escapism in Rick and Morty (2013)”</h2>

    <h3>1. <u>Introduccion</u></h3>
	<p>Rick and Morty is an adult animated science fiction sitcom created by producers
        Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon and originally broadcasted in the webpage Adult Swim<sup>1</sup>
        .
        It narrates the intergalactic misadventures of Morty and his alcoholic, scientist
        grandfather, Rick. Even though they are the two main characters, other members of the
        family appear, such as Summer, Morty’s sister, and Morty’s parents, Beth and Jerry
        Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
        The series has its origins in an animated short parody of Back to the Future<sup>2</sup>
created by Roiland for film festival Channel 101<sup>3</sup>

in 2006 called The Real Animated
Adventures of Doc and Mharti. After contacts between Adult Swim, Roiland and Harmon
several years later, Rick and Morty premiered on December 2, 2013, and due to its
success, its third season is going to be released in late 2016.
    </p>
    <p>
        Up until now, one may ask, what can make this sitcom different from others, or
worth analyzing? As said above, in its origin the Doc and Mharti short was created as a
parody to Back to the Future. This is clearly shown in the many resemblances the series
has, and I could comment on the similarities and differences that are present; or in the way
its characteristic humour may remind to that of other animated series like The Simpsons
(in his early episodes), Futurama, Family Guy or even South Park. However this will not
be the case.
    </p>
    <p>
        What I am going to do in this essay, instead, is a critical analysis of today’s
society, in order to see, through the series, what the effects of technological advances are
and the problems they bring; what society’s beliefs in political and religious terms are;
and what is done to solve (or evade) the consequences of modern life. For this purpose, I
will focus on how these aspects are reflected throughout its two seasons by paying
especial attention to two terms, nihilism<sup>4</sup>and escapism<sup>5</sup>

    <h3>2. <u>The consequences of technology upon humanity</u></h3>
	<p>The development (sometimes overdevelopment) of technologies has led to the
        creation of the modern society, a place in which a life without electronical devices is hard
        to imagine. As a way to defend them, most say that their benefits are huge, e.g. Hertlein
        & Ancheta (2014)<sup>6</sup>, but do these always bring good consequences?
    </p>
    <p>
        Nowadays, it is almost impossible to see a person without a smartphone on his
hands, robotics has advanced to the point that in Japan there are hotels that when doing the
book in, a robot with a person-like appearance or even a dinosaur attends to you. We are
so dependent, and obsessed, on machines that a question arises ‘where is this going to
lead?’
    </p>
    <p>
        To my mind come films such as I, Robot<sup>7</sup> and Ex-Machina<sup>8</sup>
        . In the first, robots are
        sold as a way to protect and help people, but they are so assimilated and so integrated in
        human’s everyday life that they realize that they are more intelligent and better than their
        creators, who are subject to death by, e.g. illnesses, so that they rebel and try to submit
        humanity to their control. On the latter a scientist is investigating about the perfect AI and
        proves it in women cyborgs. When he finds it, the robot’s consciousness is so evolved that
        she rebels and kills the scientist, escaping to the outside world. Thus, in these two cases,
        there is a direct critique on the results brought about by the power, importance and
        overdependence technologies are given nowadays.
    </p>
    <p>
        Extrapolating this to Rick and Morty (R&M from now on), the second chapter of
        season one called “Lawnmowner Dog” can be taken as an example. Rick, by petition of
        Jerry, creates a device in order to make Snuffles, Morty’s dog, smarter. As it is said in
        “Rick and Morty: A Sociological Analysis” (2015)<sup>9</sup>:
    </p>
    <p><h6>Originally the increased intelligence of Snuffles is used for the family’s entertainment.
        Snuffles quickly becomes dissatisfied with the status quo of humans ruling over dogs</h6>

    <p><h6>and takes over the world with an army of hyper-intelligent dogs. While Rick originally
        built the gadget to help the family they ended up being overrun and enslaved by a
        gadget designed to help them. The comparison can be made to other modern
        technologies such as smart phones, television and nuclear weapons. Debord (1967,
        p.7) describes how these innovations empower humans but isolate us from each other.
        While originally invented to empower and free humans, arguments can be made they
        have enslaved and isolated us in various ways.</h6>
    </p>
    <p>And this is in fact what is happening, there is a reversal in the dichotomy<sup>10</sup>
        ‘human-robot’. Humans are the ones thought as having feelings for others, while robots do
        not. However, as we are more and more plugged to machines, we are no more feeling
        empathy for other human beings, whereas the robots we create can be said to be more
        rational. This situation makes robots question why humankind must be on top, with their
        later rebellion (as in the examples above), and it also makes people selfishly blind, not
        caring about other members of the species, which leads to different reactions.
    </p>
    <p>Taking as an example the character of Rick, in the first episode<sup>11</sup> of R&M, he
        wants to destroy humanity, as he thinks that it has lived its moment and it must all start
        again, and wants his grandson to repopulate the world. At the end, after considering the
        consequences, he changes his mind. On another occasion, this time in the sixth episode of
        season one<sup>12</sup>, Rick is burying his own body of other dimension in the garden, showing no
        emotion for having killed one Rick, one human being. Morty, on the other hand, is
        struggling to do the same with his self, thinking on the effects of a lost life. “This is a
        realization that humanity itself is flawed and ultimately will care not for its own
        existence”<sup>13</sup>.
    </p>
    <p><h5>According to Italian anarchist, Errico Malatesta, Rick would belong to a special
        category of anarchists ‘which only thinks about its own individuality and has
        absolutely no hesitation in sacrificing the individuality of others’. (...) His carelessness
        seems to be bred out of apathy for the human race, and the idiocy he is surrounded
        by<sup>14</sup></h5>
    </p>
    <p>He shows no compassion or empathy and cares only about his scientific exploits
        and his incessant drinking. What concerns the others: Beth and Jerry do not care about
        their children and are only worried in quarrelling, and Summer is completely superficial
